            <p class="desperate">This night is cold in the kingdom,</p>
            <p class="lonely">I can feel you fade away</p>
            <p class="emotional">From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and</p>
            <p class="desperate">Your steps keep me awake</p>
            <p class="pleading">Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste</p>
            <p class="lonely">I once was a man with dignity and grace</p>
            <p class="desperate">Now I'm slippin' through the cracks of your cold embrace</p>
            <p class="pleading">So please, please</p>
            <p class="emotional">Could you find a way to let me down slowly?</p>
            <p class="pleading">A little sympathy, I hope you can show me</p>
            <p class="lonely">If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely</p>
            <p class="pleading">If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly</p>
            <p class="repeated">Let me down, down, down, down, down, down</p>
            <p class="repeated">Let me down, down, down, down, down, down</p>
            <p class="pleading">If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly</p>
            <p class="desperate">Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile</p>
            <p class="lonely">As I'm walking down the corridor</p>
            <p class="pleading">And I know we haven't talked in a while</p>
            <p class="lonely">So I'm looking for an open door</p>
            <p class="pleading">Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste</p>
            <p class="lonely">I once was a man with dignity and grace</p>
            <p class="desperate">Now I'm slippin' through the cracks of your cold embrace</p>
            <p class="pleading">So please, please</p>
            <p class="emotional">Could you find a way to let me down slowly?</p>
            <p class="pleading">A little sympathy, I hope you can show me</p>
            <p class="lonely">If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely</p>
            <p class="pleading">If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly</p>
